## 🎨 Design Features

### Color Scheme
- **Neon Green**: `#39FF14` - Primary accent, call-to-action buttons
- **Neon Blue**: `#00BFFF` - Secondary accents, links
- **Dark Theme**: Dark background for modern, professional appearance
- **High Contrast**: Neon colors against dark background for maximum visibility

### Layout
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Device Fingerprinting
On page load, the Landing Screen automatically:
1. Generates a comprehensive device fingerprint using browser APIs
2. Sends fingerprint to `/v1/devices/anonymous` endpoint
3. Stores device ID in localStorage for future reference
4. Used for security analytics and fraud prevention

**Fingerprint Data Collected**:
- Browser user agent
- Screen resolution and color depth
- Timezone and language preferences
- Platform and hardware information
- Browser plugins and capabilities
- Canvas fingerprinting data

### Market Data Integration
- Real-time ticker data fetched from market data APIs
- WebSocket connections for live price updates (if applicable)
- Fallback to polling if WebSocket unavailable
- Error handling for data fetch failures

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and heavy components loaded on-demand
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting for faster initial load
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- **Asset Optimization**: Compressed images and minified assets

---

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 600px)
- Single column layout
- Stacked call-to-action buttons
- Simplified market ticker (fewer assets shown)
- Touch-optimized button sizes

### Tablet (600px - 960px)
- Two-column feature showcase
- Expanded market ticker
- Medium-sized hero section

### Desktop (> 960px)
- Full multi-column layout
- Expansive hero section
- Complete market ticker with all assets
- Side-by-side feature comparisons

## 🔌 API Integration

### Anonymous Device Registration
**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/devices/anonymous`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "screenResolution": "1920x1080",
  "colorDepth": 24,
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "language": "en-US",
  "platform": "MacIntel",
  "canvasFingerprint": "abc123...",
  "webglFingerprint": "def456..."
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "deviceId": "device_abc123xyz",
  "fingerprintHash": "sha256_hash_value",
  "isNewDevice": true,
  "riskScore": 0.1
}
```

### Market Data Fetch
**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/market/ticker` (or external market data API)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "tickers": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTC-USD",
      "price": 42350.50,
      "change24h": 2.45,
      "changePercent": 5.78
    },
    {
      "symbol": "ETH-USD",
      "price": 2245.75,
      "change24h": -1.23,
      "changePercent": -2.15
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Authenticated users see landing page briefly before redirect
**Solution**: Implement authentication check in a suspense boundary or loading state to prevent flash of unauthenticated content.

### Issue: Market ticker not updating
**Solution**: Check WebSocket connection status, verify API endpoint accessibility, ensure fallback polling is working.

### Issue: Device registration fails silently
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify `/v1/devices/anonymous` endpoint is accessible, ensure CORS headers are properly configured.
